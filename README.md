CRUD Admin Generator
===================

What is CRUD Admin Generator?
-----------------------------

**CRUD Admin Generator** ([http://crud-admin-generator.com][1]) is a tool to **generate a complete backend from a MySql database** where you can create, read, update and delete records in a database. 

**The backend is generated in seconds** without configuration files where there is a lot of *"magic"* and is very difficult to adapt to your needs. 

**The generated code is fully customizable and extensible.**

It has been programmed with the Silex framework, so the resulting code is PHP.


Installation
------------

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/jonseg/crud-admin-generator.git admingenerator

    cd admingenerator

Download composer:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install vendors:

    php composer.phar install

You need point the document root of your virtual host to /path_to/admingenerator/web

This is an example of VirtualHost:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /path_to/admingenerator/web
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        <Directory "/path_to/admingenerator/web">
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            Order Allow,Deny
            Allow from all
            AllowOverride all
            <IfModule mod_php5.c>
                php_admin_flag engine on
                php_admin_flag safe_mode off
                php_admin_value open_basedir none
            </ifModule>
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    
You can customize the url using the .htaccess file, maybe this will help you:

Database Configuration
---------------------
Configuration to connect to database is stored inside `.env` file. If the `.env` file is not in available in root of your project directory, you can rename `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the value there according to your database.

Generate CRUD backend
---------------------

You need to set the url of the resources folder.

Change this line:

    $app['asset_path'] = '/resources';

For the url of your project, for example:

    $app['asset_path'] = 'http://domain.com/crudadmin/resources';


Now, execute the command that will generate the CRUD backend:

    php console generate:admin

**This is it!** Now access with your favorite web browser.


The command generates one menu section for each database table. **Now will be much easier to list, create, edit and delete rows!**


Customize the result
--------------------

The generated code is fully configurable and editable, you just have to edit the corresponding files.

 - The **controller** you can find it in **/web/controllers/TABLE_NAME/index.php**
 - The **views** are in **/web/views/TABLE_NAME**

It has generated a folder for each database table.

Serve Using Built-in PHP Server
--------------------
If you want to serve this project using built-in PHP server, run: `composer run serve`. It will serve the project from localhost:8888. To change the port to something other than 8888, you can edit it inside `composer.json`:

```
"serve": [
	"php -S localhost:8888 -t web"
]
```
